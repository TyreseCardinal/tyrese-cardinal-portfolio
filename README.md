# Tyrese Cardinal – Portfolio Website

My personal portfolio site — a place to build, break, and rebuild while showing off projects, notes, and experiments as I grow as a developer.  

Built from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, hosted on **Ubuntu + Nginx**, and expanding over time with **Vue** and optional backend features.

### 📁 Current Features
- Home, About, Projects, and Blog sections
- Simple responsive layout
- Markdown-style blog entries
- Version-controlled workflow (Git + GitHub)

### 🧩 Stack
- HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Vue.js (coming soon)
- Nginx on Ubuntu 24.04
- Git + GitHub for version control
