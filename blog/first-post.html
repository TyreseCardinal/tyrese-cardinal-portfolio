  <h1>Finally Starting My Portfolio Site</h1>
  <p class="date">October 21st, 2025</p>

  <p>
    After many delays in starting my portfolio, out of fear of failure and
    perfectionism, I've finally decided to stop procrastinating and avoiding it
    and to just start and gain some momentum. I’ve been overthinking what to
    include, how it should look, and whether it’ll ever be good enough—but I
    realized it's not going to build itself, and YOLO.

  <h2>What I Set Up</h2>
  <p>
    I created my project folder, built a simple homepage, and added a blog
    directory. It’s not flashy, but it works—and that’s all I care about right
    now.

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes the hardest part isn’t the coding—it’s getting past the hesitation
    to begin. Plus, I'm bored of xbox and need to do something productive.

  <h2>What’s Next</h2>
  <p>
    Depends where I finish tonight. Let's see where this 3AM surge of motivation
    takes me I guess.

  <h2>Takeaway</h2>
  <p>
    Perfection is hilariously evil with how much time it can waste. It is a
    toxic mindset to have when trying to create anything, it doesn't exist in
    the real world, just do it. - Nike or - Shia Labeouf.
